# Hangman Game 🎯

A simple Hangman game to test your word-guessing skills.  
Made with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 📚 About This Project

This project was originally built by following a tutorial, which guided me through the development of a basic Hangman game using JavaScript.  

The tutorial was quite challenging, but it helped me significantly improve my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic. It was a great learning experience.

After completing the tutorial, I personalized the project by adding my own touches and improvements — making it feel more custom and unique.

## ✨ Custom Features Added

- A custom color scheme and visual enhancements
- Minor feature changes to improve user experience
- Small tweaks to the original logic to make the game more interactive and responsive

These additions are not part of the original tutorial and were implemented independently to enhance the game's feel and functionality.

## 🕹️ Features

- Random word selection
- Interactive keyboard input
- Visual feedback for correct and wrong guesses
- Responsive and clean layout
